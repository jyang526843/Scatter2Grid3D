# Scatter2Grid3D
Matlab code: Interpolate 3D scatterred data to gridded data and compute their gradients

# funDerivativeOp3
Matlab code: Generate a central finite difference operator to compute gradients

****** ATTENTION ****** <p>
% The "x,y,z" or "1-,2-,3-" coordinates in this exchange file correspond to <p>
% the 1st, 2nd and 3rd indices of Matlab workspace variable. For example, <p>
% p_meas(:,1) and p_meas(:,2) are the x- & y-coordinates of scattered points. <p>
% <p>
% This is a little different from some MATLAB image processing functions. <p>
% For example, if a 3D image has size M*N*L, in this code, we always have <p>
% the image size_x=M, size_y=N, size_z=L. If you use some Matlab computer <p>
% vision/image post-processing function, for example, 'imagesc3D', or <p>
% 'imagesc', or 'imshow', or 'surf', it will reads size_x=N, size_y=M, size_z=L.<p>

% Please pay attention to this. <p>
